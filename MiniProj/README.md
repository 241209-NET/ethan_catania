# Blackjack Game

## Play against a dealer to get the closest to 21 without going over. 

To Play ---> open a terminal and run "dotnet run".

This will prompt the user to enter "y" if they are ready to play. 
Other entries will end the game.

The dealer will always be dealt first, and the player will always be dealt second.
The game will keep track of the totals of each players cards and will follow a back and forth nature until a player has gone over 21, or both players have stayed at their totals. 

Upon the end of a game, the user will be prompted to play another game, in which a "y" will play another and any other entry will terminate the game. 

Have Fun!
